Ideas:

1. On the "AddNew" page, add an input where the user can enter the date of receipt,
if the input is empty, then Date.now() will be written

Questions:

1. What about year? What if our user has been using this app for over a year.


Accepted:

1. Add input for date on "AddNewReceipt"
2. Add year on receipts on "AllReceipts"
3. Add page for "Custom Period" on page "AllReceipts"
